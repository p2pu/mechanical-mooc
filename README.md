# Mechanical MOOC

The Mechanical MOOC is a web based app that allows users to sign up for a course, send out regular email updates about the course and group people into small groups where they can discuss the course with their peers. Nothing more and nothing less.

## Running your own instance

The Mechanical MOOC is written as a Django application. You can use any hosting provider, but the easiest way to get going quickly is with [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Get the code from github `git clone https://github.com/p2pu/mechanical-mooc`

After [setting up a heroku account](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart#step-4-deploy-an-application) if you havent already, run `heroku create` and `git push heroku master`

You will need to create the database using `heroku run python manage.py syncdb --migrate`. If the migration fails, comment out the following line in the settings.py file. You only need it if you are migrating an existing DB (e.g. you already have signed-up users for example). 

    'south',

Then run `heroku run python manage.py syncdb`

For sending email and managing mailing lists we use [mailgun](http://mailgun.com/). Unfortunately mailgun doesn't have a free account option, so sending out emails will cost some money :( You will need to set up a mailgun account and get the API keys.

Running mailgun requires that you have a domain name set up (the @whatever.com where your emails will come from). See the mailgun documentation for instructions on how to configure this.

You will need to set a few configuration variables on heroku:
- MAILGUN_API_DOMAIN - the domain that you will use for email
- MAILGUN_API_KEY - your mailgun API key
- DEFAULT_FROM_ADDRESS - the email address that will be used when sending out emails
- EMAIL_DOMAIN - the same as the MAILGUN_API_DOMAIN (we probably need to remove this)

You can set these variables by running `heroku config:set MAILGUN_API_DOMAIN=yourdomain.org`

After all this you will need to create the database on heroku `heroku run python manage.py syncdb`

You will also need to create a sequence for your MOOC. A sequence is like a single run of your course, obviously your course will be a resounding success and you will want to run many more!

    heroku run python manage.py shell
    > from sequence import models
    > from datetime import datetime
    > start_date = datetime(2013, 12, 1)
    > signup_close_date = datetime(2013, 11, 23)
    > models.create_sequence(start_date, signup_close_date)
    > exit()

And then you will need to add the tasks that will send out the emails to new signups and scheduled emails. You can enable the scheduler by running `heroku addons:add scheduler:standard`

To add the actual tasks, you need to log into your application dashboard. `heroku addons:open scheduler` will get you there quickly. The two scripts that you need to add are

    heroku run python manage.py handle_new_signups

and

    heroku run python manage.py send_scheduled_mail

The first task should run every 10 minutes and the second task is should run every hour.

That's it, you are all set up to run your very own Mechanical Mooc and enlighten the world with peer learning!
