<p>Hi there, Moocster,</p>

<p>Before the course starts we would like to have some fun and make a class photo of everyone taking this MOOC. Take a second to upload your profile picture to the Class Photo!</p>

<p>You can follow <a href="http://{{ mooc_domain }}{% url classphoto_classphoto sequence=sequence %}?key=%recipient.key%">this link</a> to view your cohort and add your photo.</p>

<p>What a good-looking group!</p>
