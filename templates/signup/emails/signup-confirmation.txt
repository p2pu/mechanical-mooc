Greetings Mechanical MOOCsters,

Welcome to A Gentle Introduction to Python, the world's first Mechanical Massive Open Online Course.  This course is created by the Mechanical MOOC out of existing, openly available educational resources across the web, including course materials from MIT, study groups from OpenStudy, and exercises from Codecademy.  P2PU has built the machine that powers the experience and can connect you to a small group of peers.

The next round of the course begins June, 2013. You should expect to begin receiving e-mails preparing you for the course in the last week of May.  If you’re signing up near the start of the course, you can access a full archive of e-mails for the course at http://mechanicalmooc.wordpress.com/category/seq26nov12/

The Mechanical MOOC reminds you there is no course instructor on this journey--you and your peers will rely on each other to understand the content and figure out the difficult concepts.  We believe we've assembled some of the best tools out there for learning independently and connecting with a large support group, but the energy that will power the course comes from you.

Rest up, and prepare to learn Python!

The Mechanical MOOC
