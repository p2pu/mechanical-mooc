Welcome to "Play With Your Music"--we'll get underway in earnest around November 1st. 

First, two things you should know:

Browser requirements. We recommend you use Google Chrome for Play With Your Music--it's compatible with all of the tools we are using. You can download it here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/

Next steps. You'll receive an email shortly from the #PYYM team asking you a few more questions before we get started. 

The tools you'll need. In the meantime, you might want to register for an account with Soundation (http://soundation.com/) and SoundCloud (https://soundcloud.com/). We recommend signing up and installing any plugins you might need, like Adobe AIR.

If you have any #PWYM-related questions, you can post them to our Google+ community: http://bit.ly/1aiSsfw

Now you're vaguely rockin'...
