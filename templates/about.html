         <p>"Play With Your Music" is a free, 6-week online course where you'll make 3-5 songs of your very own, using the newest tools on the web. You'll learn the in's and out's of audio production, while working with music you already know and love. Anyone with an interest in making music is welcome, and all you need is a computer and a browser.</p>

         <p>"Play With Your Music" (or #PWYM) is a nifty partnership between faculty in <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/">NYU Steinhardt</a>'s <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/">Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions</a> and <a href="https://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a>. Professor <a href="http://www.alexruthmann.com/blog1/">Alex Ruthmann</a> and Research Assistant <a href="http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/">Ethan Hein</a> offer their expertise and musical chops, all brought to you with the social learning design team at P2PU.</p>

         <p>The Mechanical MOOC is a super-simple platform made by the crew over at P2PU. It splits learners into smaller cohorts and connects them via email. So you'll participate in the course in your small cohort via your inbox, and the larger G+ community.</p>
